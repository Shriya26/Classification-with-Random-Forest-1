# Classification-with-Random-Forest-1
Random Forest- Advance Project 9

Use Case
A cloth manufacturing company wants to identify key factors that drive **high product sales**. Using machine learning, specifically the **Random Forest Classifier**, this project categorizes sales as **"High"** or **"Low"** and analyzes which product, marketing, or demographic features influence this outcome.

 Objective
- Convert continuous sales figures into a binary classification: **High** and **Low**
- Build a model to predict sales performance using attributes such as:
  - `Price`
  - `Advertising`
  - `Shelve Location`
  - `Income`
  - `Urban/US Market`
- Derive business insights for improving sales strategy
---
 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data wrangling and manipulation
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** – Exploratory Data Analysis and visualizations
- **Scikit-learn** – Model building and evaluation (Random Forest)
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Development and analysis environment
- **HTML Export** – For sharing EDA and model results in readable format

Key Insights Gathered
- **Advertising** and **Shelve Location** are the strongest predictors of high sales
- Products placed in **"Good" shelves** consistently showed higher performance
- **Lower Price** and **Higher Advertising Spend** correlated with better sales outcomes
- Urban and US markets did not significantly impact sales on their own but in combination with shelving and price, they showed compound effects
